PixelNutApp Arduino Library
================================================================

This library is a collection of common application code that you can use, along with other libraries from PixelNut (PixelNutLib, BluefruitStrs, UIDevices, and NeoPixelShow Libraries), to create your own PixelNut! applications.

After downloading, rename folder to 'PixelNutApp' and install in the Arduino Libraries folder.

The examples that come with this library are in fact the very same applications that are used in various PixelNut! Products, which are commercially available (see www.pixelnutstore.com).

For more information, read "how-library-works.md".

For details on specific features: "application-features.md".

For descriptions of the patterns that are included in example applications with physical controls: "preset-descriptions.md".

The following are features actively being worked on:

1) Support for additional processors, including ESP32 and the Particle Photon.

2) Support for the communications over commands over WiFi (in addition to the current Bluetooth support).

3) Support for hardware input devices such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, range finders, microphones, and solar cells.
