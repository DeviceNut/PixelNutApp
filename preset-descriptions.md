PixelNut! Preset Pattern Descriptions
===============================================================

PixelNut products with physical control buttons come with 13 built-in pattern presets.

"Triggering" means double pressing the pattern button, with the amount of time it is held determining the amount of "Force" the trigger will have: holding the second press down for 1 second will deliver the maximum force.

1) "Rainbow Ripple"

Color hue changes "ripple" down the strip. The colors move through the spectrum, and appear stationary until Triggered. The Force applied changes the amount of color change per pixel. At maximum Force the entire spectrum is displayed again.

2) "Rainbow Roll"

Colors hue changes occur at the head and get pushed down the strip. When the end is reached they start getting cleared, creating a "rolling" effect. Triggering restarts the effect, with the amount of Force determining how fast the colors change. At the maximum Force the entire spectrum is displayed again.


3) "Light Waves"

This creates a "wave" effect (brightness that changes up and down) that move down the strip, in a single color. Triggering changes the frequency of the waves, with larger Forces making longer waves.


4) "Blue Twinkle"

This has bright white twinkling over a soft blue background, like "stars in a blue sky". Triggering causes the background brightness to swell up and down, with the amount of Force determining the speed of the swelling.


5) "Twinkle Comets"

This also has bright white twinkling, but without a background. Instead, there are occasional comets that streak up and down the strip, and then disappear. One of the comets is red, is a fixed length, and appears randomly every 3-6 seconds. The other is orange, and appears only when Triggered, with the Force determining its length.


6) "Dueling Comets"

Comets pairs, one in either direction, both of which change color hue (but not whiteness) occasionaly. Trigging causes new comets to be added (that keep going around), for a maximum of 12 per direction.


7) "Dueling Scanners"

Two scanners (blocks of same brightness pixels that move back and forth), with only the first one visible initially until a Trigger is applied. The first one changes colors on each change in direction. The second one (once Triggered) is deep purple, moves in the opposite direction, and periodically surges in speed.


8) "Ferris Wheel"

Evenly spaced pixels ("spokes") move together around and around the strip, creating a "Ferris Wheel" effect. The spokes periodically change to random colors. Triggering toggles the direction, and determines how many spokes there are (larger
Forces for more spokes).


9) "Expanding Noise"

The background is white-ish noise (randomly sets pixels with random brightness of unsaturated colors, slowly and continuously expand and contract, with the Force used when Triggering determining the extent of the expansion.


10) "Blink Surges"

Random colored blinking that periodically surge in the rate of blinking. Triggering changes the frequency of the blinking, with larger Forces causing faster blinking surges.


11) "Bright Swells"

 All pixels swell up and down in brightness, with random color hue and whiteness changes every 10 seconds. Triggering changes the pace of the swelling, with larger Forces causing faster swelling.


12) "Color Smooth"

All pixels move through color hue and whiteness transitions that are slow and smooth. A new color is chosen every time the previous target color has been reached, or when Triggered, with the Force determining how large the reoccurring color changes are. The time it takes to reach a new color is proportional to the size of the color change.


13) "MashUp"

Combination of a purple scanner over a green-ish twinkling background, with a red comet that is fired off every time the scanner bounces off the end of the strip, or when Triggered, which disappear off the end.
